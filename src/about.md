## About This Project

This site is a wiki-style resource for understanding modern theoretical physics with a strong emphasis on mathematical concepts.

### Goals

- Make **Quantum Field Theory** and **Quantum Mechanics** accessible to mathematicians and undergraduate students
- Provide clear explanations of specific formulas and their derivations
- Answer common questions with mathematical rigor
- Explain how particle physics concepts connect to their mathematical foundations

### Approach

Each topic aims to bridge the gap between physics intuition and mathematical formalism. We emphasize:

- **Precise definitions**: What are the actual mathematical objects involved?
- **Connections**: How do different concepts relate to each other?
- **Structure**: What are the underlying symmetries and algebraic structures?

### Topics Covered

- **Quantum Field Theory**: From classical fields to second quantization
- **The Standard Model**: Gauge groups, particle representations, symmetry breaking
- **General Relativity**: Differential geometry, spacetime structure
- **Mathematical Foundations**: Lie groups, fiber bundles, representation theory

### A Note on Content Generation

Most of the content on this site has been generated using **Large Language Model (LLM) systems**, specifically Claude by Anthropic. The content has been reviewed for accuracy, but given the complexity of the subject matter, errors may exist.

We believe that LLMs can be valuable tools for creating educational content, especially when used in dialogue with domain experts who can verify and refine the output.

### Contributing

This is a work in progress. Topics are added and refined over time as questions arise and understanding deepens.

**We welcome contributions!** If you find errors, have suggestions for improvements, or want to add new content, please submit a pull request at:

Contributions of all kinds are appreciated:
- Corrections of mathematical or physical errors
- Clarifications of confusing explanations
- New topics or expanded coverage
- Improved formatting or diagrams
- References to primary sources
