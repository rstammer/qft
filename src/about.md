## About This Project

This site is a wiki-style resource for understanding modern theoretical physics with a strong emphasis on mathematical precision.

### Goals

- Make **Quantum Field Theory** and **Quantum Mechanics** accessible to mathematicians and undergraduate students
- Provide clear explanations of specific formulas and their derivations
- Answer common questions with mathematical rigor
- Explain how particle physics concepts connect to their mathematical foundations

### Approach

Each topic aims to bridge the gap between physics intuition and mathematical formalism. We emphasize:

- **Precise definitions**: What are the actual mathematical objects involved?
- **Connections**: How do different concepts relate to each other?
- **Structure**: What are the underlying symmetries and algebraic structures?

### Topics Covered

- **Quantum Field Theory**: From classical fields to second quantization
- **The Standard Model**: Gauge groups, particle representations, symmetry breaking
- **General Relativity**: Differential geometry, spacetime structure
- **Mathematical Foundations**: Lie groups, fiber bundles, representation theory

### Contributing

This is a work in progress. Topics are added and refined over time as questions arise and understanding deepens.
