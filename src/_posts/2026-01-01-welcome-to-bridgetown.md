Welcome to this wiki on modern theoretical physics! The goal is to make Quantum Field Theory, the Standard Model, and General Relativity accessible to mathematicians and undergraduate students.

## What You'll Find Here

### Questions & Answers

The Q&A section addresses specific questions like:

- Is QFT based on Riemannian geometry?
- What is a Lagrangian?
- How does the Heisenberg uncertainty principle relate to Lie algebras?

Each answer aims to be mathematically precise while remaining accessible.

### Articles

Longer explorations of specific topics, including:

- Mathematical foundations (Lie groups, fiber bundles, differential geometry)
- The structure of the Standard Model
- Connections between physics and pure mathematics

## Mathematical Notation

This site supports LaTeX rendering. For example, the Dirac equation:

<span class="math-display">(i\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu - m)\psi = 0</span>

Or inline math like the fine structure constant <span class="math-inline">\alpha \approx 1/137</span>.

## Contributing

This is a work in progress. Topics will be added and refined over time.
